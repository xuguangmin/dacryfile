The old README is preserved for posterity, but it is wrong. This is the limit
of the development of dacryfile. Work has begun on a second generation binary
protector, which doesn't use virus techniques at all. Some of this code is
actually quite useful, for instance the injector will inject any object code
into an ELF. If someone where to use it to infect binaries, I would be quite
pissed off, however... that is a possible to do.


peace,
