 * libdl.h :
 * 	defines and function defs for libdl.c
 *
 * 	libdl.o needs to be linked in with the other object code to be loaded,
 * 	in order to provide its fucktionality.  
 *
 * 	libdl.o will allow the dynamic linking against libraries that the
 * 	host file has had mmapped into its address space.  libdl will not 
 * 	mmap in new libraries, but if you can get by with libc then you will
 * 	pretty much be OK.
 *
 * 	The interface is described below.
 * 	!! BE AWARE that this version of libdl uses the heap !!
 * 	if you require a stack based libdl, then uses libdl_stack, which
 * 	is availble in this distro..
