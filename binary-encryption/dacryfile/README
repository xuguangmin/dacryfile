=====================================================

The basic idea is that the decryptor stub is constructed from the crt1.o object
and any other object files required by the vx_main.o... they are combined into
a huge objectfile, which is then relocated for internal references... This 
allows the parasite to be "arbitrarily" complex. There is no space restriction 
on the parasite.

The file ./obj/host has been injected and encrypted. Try it, and you will see
that it works... there is some debugging information being dumped out right now
but ignore that... this isn't even alpha software! :)

The trial can be played with, under obj/ just try "make test"... You will want
to note that host.orig is the uber-elite "Hello World" program. Then we encrypt,
starting at .text, through to the end of the first PT_LOAD segment. The 
parasite decryptor stub is injected, and then we write out the file. 

This whole thing is very quick, but its a hack right now. Lots of hard coded
cruft, and the like. I am close to being done with it though, because this is
only the prototype for a "real" program: dacryfile.

peace,
