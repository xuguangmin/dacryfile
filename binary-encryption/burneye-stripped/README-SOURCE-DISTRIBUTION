This is about thirty percent of the original burneye source code. This source
distribution is to be used for educational purposes, so you can play with the
things mentioned in the phrack article.

Note that the sourcefile which contains copyright licenses that require GPL
(only snprintf.c from wuftpd so far) are only present in this source
distribution for debug purposes in this example source. They are never
distributed with the binary version of burneye.


The parts of this distribution which are not covered by other licenses are
released under a BSD like license without the ad clause. I.e. you are allowed
to do anything with the source, but do not blame me for any results.
