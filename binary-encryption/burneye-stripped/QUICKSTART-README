It does work currently.

Anyway, quickstart, you need: nasm, ld, binutils, gcc
Build: in src/ do:

make clean all


./burneye <executeable> will produce ./output then, which is a wrapped ELF
executeable. You have to chmod it and then you can try to execute it. Run only
./burneye to get a quick help, everything should be self-explaining.


I would like to thank John Reiser, acpizer, grugq, silvio, lorian and random
for fixes, ideas, and various other support. Thanks ! :)
